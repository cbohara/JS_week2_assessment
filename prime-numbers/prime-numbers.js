1.Define the rules of the problem 
	determine if the input value is a prime number
	a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself
2.Determine inputs and outputs
	input: test value
	output: prime number is true, non-prime is false
3.Explore the problem and discover techniques or patterns that might be useful
	what algorthims are already out there to determine if a number is prime or not?
	does JS have a built in function?
4.Generate a simple plan that should solve the problem
5.Turn that plan into steps- put your pseudocode skills to use!

example: 

isPrime(13) --> true;
isPrime(15) --> false;



*EXTRA* expand your isPrime to an isPrimeArray function to loop through an array of numbers, collect the prime numbers, and return them to the user. If there are no prime numbers in the array, isPrimeArray returns 'there are no primes';

var primeArray = [7, 14, 27, 671]; 

var nonPrimeArray = [9, 15, 20]

isPrimeArray(primeArray); ---> [7, 671];
isPrimeArray(nonPrimeArray) ---> 'there are no primes';
